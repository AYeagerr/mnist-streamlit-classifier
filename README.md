# mnist-streamlit-classifier
An end-to-end machine learning system that recognizes handwritten digits (0â€“9) from the MNIST dataset. The project includes data preprocessing, training three different models (Logistic Regression, ANN, and CNN), and a Streamlit web app that allows users to draw digits and get real-time predictions.
